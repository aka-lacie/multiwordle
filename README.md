This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

A multiplayer, collaborative Wordle game. This project uses Next.js and Socket.io, which was largely an educational choice.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To simulate multiple players, open in incognito windows.
